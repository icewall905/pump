I'll dig my grave
If it's mine to choose
Feels like there's nothing left for me to lose
I'll dig my grave

How many times I've got to tell you
I'm all caught up in bad advice
So many times, I've had to hear you say you
I know what you got to do

I used to hang on words
I'd make mine sting if you stung me first
But I'm
Passed the point of needing you
To understand my views
It gets lonely, but I've learned that now
There's more emptiness in the smiles you're forced to wear

I'll dig my grave
If it's mine to choose
Feels like there's nothing left for me to lose
I'll dig my grave

There's that obsession again
With everything going to plan
Sometimes I, hear the fear in your voice
And then I
Think of the poisonous words, Imagine
The only way that we can connect
Is when we're looking back with reflective moods
Then I remember you too

It gets lonely, but I've learned to shake
The feeling that these walls are caving in

I'll dig my grave
If it's mine to choose
Feels like there's nothing left for me to lose
I'll dig my grave

Oh, tempers rising
And you're still fanning the flames
Blew the ceiling off, with patience gone
Our house burning down again
How many times do I got to tell you
I'm all caught up in bad advice
How many times do I got to tell you
I know what I've got to do
You don't believe my words
But I believe yours when our roles reverse
And then I, feel like a liar
Even when I tell the truth

But it's okay, have it your way
Feels like there's nothing left for me to say
I can't change your mind
I know I've tried
Feels like there's nothing left for me to hide
So, I'll dig my grave
If it's mine to choose
Feels like there's nothing left for me to lose

So, I'll dig my grave
If it's mine to choose
Feels like there's nothing left for me to lose
So, I'll dig my grave
