We're up a new wave
But it's a new age
Where the kids on the fringe have a tv set
In their pockets
Nowhere to runaway

All the freedoms, communication
The news stations 24 hours a day
Is there a problem?
Tell me what's your name?
What's your game?
Can hardly wait just to give it away
Out of your head
And out of your mind
So off the wall but you're still online

We found a new place
To pack our sad tapes
Now we're rolling around on a box of whiz
No distractions
Some more interactions
We found a new way
Reach out and touch faith
With no distractions
You tell me what's your name?
What's your game?
Can hardly wait just to give it away
Out of your head
And out of your mind
So off the wall but you're still online

Why do we choose it?
I feel like we're losing it
Who are we fooling?
The voice is loud but around and around we go
Why do we choose it?
I feel like I'm losing sleep
Who are we fooling?
The voice is loud but around and around we go

So it's a new day
To find a new place
To disappear from the noise of a busy street
No more complaining
I find it draining
Oh I want some silence
This solitude is bliss
Sleepwalking's a daydream

Oh what's your name?
What's your game?
Can hardly wait just to give it away
Out of your head
And out of your mind
So off the wall but you're still online

Why do we choose it?
I feel like I'm losing it
Who are we fooling?
The voice is loud but around and around we go
Why do we choose it?
I feel like I'm losing sleep
Who are we fooling?
The voice is loud but around and around we go
