Clean dirty dishes up oft my last table
Been at it since half past seven
She's going to meet me for a walk right after class

Its not much but it feels like heaven

You know we dont have the money
So we play pretend
So what we're knee deep in debt
We've got time to spend
Where the rich kids flaunt a life we cant afford
Well thats all fine and dandy
At least we're never bored
After a long day
We somehow make this shack feel like a home
On a dog day afternoon
Stay up long after midnight
To catch the pink sunrise in the morning
Feel the heat of the sun through the window pane
Hear the sound of the cities warning, again
Its a warm summer evening
The streets are packed
Take the subway right downtown
The red line track
To the old fashion district
See the newest trends
Where we take in the neon lights
Through a camera lens
After a long day
She falls asleep on my shoulder on the last train home
And the stations become a blur
And I get afraid
Of the suitcases and the silence
And the feeling that Someday that could be us
On the long train
But you know we dont have the money
So we play pretend
Havent built our castle in the sky to defend
Well weve got the imagination
Without the stress
Ill skip the suit, you skip the dress
Well we know we dont have the money
So we play pretend
So what we're knee deep in debt
We've got time to spend
Oh
We know we dont have the money
So we play pretend
So what we're knee deep in debt
We've got time to spend
After a long day
Theres nowhere in the world id rather be
Than right here, broke with you On the long train home
