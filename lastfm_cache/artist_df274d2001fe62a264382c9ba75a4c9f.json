He went on to study political philosophy at a Utah State University, soon returning to his native Vancouver in 1995 to begin writing songs.\n\nHis debut album, 'Tal Bachman', was released by Columbia in 1999. Scoring a smash hit with \"She's So High\", a pop/rock tune that achieved major airplay both in the U.S. and Canada, he earned much critical praise. The aforementioned tune won him a BMI award and he also scored a Juno for being Best New Solo Artist of the year. Bachman's work has also appeared on many mutli-artist collaboration albums over the years. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tal+Bachman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
