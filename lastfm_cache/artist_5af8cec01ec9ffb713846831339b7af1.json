This album contained the band's first, and so far biggest, hit, Teenage Dirtbag (from the movie Loser). \n\nFor the bands second album, Hand Over Your Loved Ones, Shannon Harris (from Relish) joined on keyboards. Due to disagreements with the record label, mostly caused by Brendan Brown's wish to self-produce the album, the album received little promotion and did not sell well.\n\nMichael Bellar (keyboards) then joined the band and they re-released their second album (containing two new songs) on their own record label, Montauk Mantis, this time named Suck Fony. In 2005 they released their third studio album, TooSoonMonsoon, once again on their own label.\n\nIn 2005, both Mike McCabe (bass) and Michael Bellar (keyboards) left and were replaced by Nicolas diPierro and Gerard Hoffman. Then the following year, diPierro and Pete Brown left and were replaced by Matt Milligan (bass) and Kevin Garcia (drums).\n\nCurrent lineup:\nBrendan Brown (vocals)\nMatt Milligan (bass)\nGerald Hoffman (keyboards)\nKevin Garcia (drums)\nJohanna Cranitch (backing vocals)\nGeorgia Haege (backing vocals)\n\nWeb-page: http://www.wheatus.com/\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wheatus\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
